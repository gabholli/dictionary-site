# Dictionary

A straightforward dictionary site created using React drawing from an API.

The address is: https://gabholli-dictionary.netlify.app

I implemented code to fetch the data from the chosen dicionary API using useEffect.
I also passed down properties to the appropriate component files to allow for
proper rendering of the API information.

I used a simple CSS grid structure to form the way the information is shown on the page.

Additionally, I used an uncontrolled form input for simplicity's sake for the search form.
